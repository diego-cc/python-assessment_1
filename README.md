# Python - Assessment 1

In this assessment, I chose the __deck of cards__ as a doubly linked list for Part A and __arranging numbers__ in a binary tree for Part B.

Test and debugging evidence are available in each directory (`Part_A` and `Part_B`).

## Run
To run each part of the assessment, move to the appropriate directory (e.g. `Part_A` or `Part_B`) and then execute in a terminal:

```
python main.py
```

## Test
To run unit tests for each part, move to the designated folder (`Part_A` or `Part_B`) and execute in a terminal:

```
python -m unittest discover
```
